1. Carbon is the sixth element, with a ground-state electron configuration of 1s22s22p2, of which the four outer electrons are valence electrons. 

2. Its first four ionisation energies, 1086.5, 2352.6, 4620.5 and 6222.7 kJ/mol, are much higher than those of the heavier group-14 elements. 

3. The electronegativity of carbon is 2.5, significantly higher than the heavier group-14 elements (1.8â€“1.9), but close to most of the nearby nonmetals, as well as some of the second- and third-row transition metals.
