Diamondium is a seemingly indestructible crystal element, presumably made out of some sort of form of diamond, invented by Hubert J. Farnsworth. 

Diamondium's main purpose was to be used by a planetary protective shell to protect Earth from the inter-dimensional tentacle creature Yivo. Professor Farnsworth also seemed to develop Diamondium into a projectile bullet in an another creation called a Diamondium Cannon.
