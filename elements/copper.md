[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper): Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu (from Latin: cuprum) and atomic number 29.

Copper has been in use at least 10,000 years, but more than 95% of all copper ever mined and smelted has been extracted since 1900, and more than half was extracted the last 24 years.
