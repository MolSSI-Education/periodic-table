Fun fact: This element did not receive its name from the musician Freddie Mercury, contrary to popular belief.
Another fun fact: people used mercury salts as make up. This was not an issue as long as it stayed on their faces, but when
they licked the makeup brush to apply it, they got mercury poisoning.
