Lithium is a silver metal that reacts violently with water. It's useful for high capacity batteries and made electric cars more viable. The creators of the lithium-ion battery, John B. Goodenough, M. Stanley Whittingham, and Akira Yoshino, won a noble prize in 2019 for its creation. It has also been used as a drug to treat bipolar disorder. Evanescence made a poppin' song about it.
