title: Palladium
---

Palladium is a chemical element with the symbol Pd and atomic number 46. It is a rare and lustrous silvery-white metal discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston. He named it after the asteroid Pallas, which was itself named after the epithet of the Greek goddess Athena, acquired by her when she slew Pallas. Palladium, platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and osmium form a group of elements referred to as the platinum group metals (PGMs). These have similar chemical properties, but palladium has the lowest melting point and is the least dense of them.

## Who knew?

* The U.S. imports about 90 percent of the platinum-group elements it uses, including palladium, according to the USGS.
* Palladium's most incredible ability is that it can absorb up to 900 times its volume of hydrogen, according to the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. Because of this ability, palladium is used to store and filter hydrogen.
* Want a long-lasting photograph? Look into platinotyping. This method of photo printing using platinum and palladium salts, which become embedded in the photo paper, according to Tillman Crane photography. Platinotypes are prized for their matte appearance and archival stability — as long as the paper remains intact, so will the photograph.
* Palladium is relatively biologically inactive, but can cause allergic reactions in some people. If you have a nickel allergy, you're at higher risk of irritation from palladium, too, according to a 2002 paper in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health.
* Iron Man knows a thing or two about the metal. His amazing powers supposedly come from the "arc reactor" embedded in his chest. Turns out, the superhero is being slowly poisoned from the reactor's palladium. In reality, palladium can be toxic to the body. For instance, a study in rat hearts published in the journal Medical Chemistry found that an inorganic palladium compound decreased heart rate and blood pressure.
