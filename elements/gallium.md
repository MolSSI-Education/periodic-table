title: Gallium

Gallium is an element similar to aluminium (it is indeed in the same group of the periodic table). It melts at around 86 Â°F. 
Since chemists love jokes, gallium can be used to make silverware (such as a spoon!). It can be used to serve tea. However, it is going to melt in the cup, and thus disappear.
