title: Gallium
---

Gallium is an element similar to aluminium (it is indeed in the same group of the periodic table). It melts at around 86 Â°F. Metallic gallium is non-toxic.
Since chemists love jokes, gallium can be used to make silverware (such as a spoon!). Why don't you try to use it to serve tea to your guests, and surprise them with a magic trick?
(There is no magic, it's just physics :D )
