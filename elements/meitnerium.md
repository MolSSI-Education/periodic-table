Symbol : Mt
Atomic Number: 109

1. Named after Lise Meitner: The element is named after Lise Meitner, an Austrian-Swedish physicist who made significant contributions to the discovery of nuclear fission.

2. Synthetic Element: Meitnerium is a man-made element and is not found naturally on Earth. It is produced in laboratories through nuclear reactions involving heavy ion bombardment.

3. First Synthesis: Meitnerium was first synthesized in 1982 by a team of German researchers led by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried MÃ¼nzenberg at the Institute for Heavy Ion Research (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany.

4. Short Half-Life: Meitnerium has a very short half-life, meaning it is highly unstable and rapidly decays into other elements. Its most stable isotope, Meitnerium-278, has a half-life of only a few seconds.

5. Predicted Properties: Since it is a transactinide element, its chemical and physical properties are not well-studied due to its short-lived nature. However, it is likely to be a solid metal at room temperature.

6. Not Used Commercially: Due to its scarcity and limited availability, Meitnerium has no practical applications and is primarily of scientific interest to researchers studying the properties of superheavy elements.

7. Part of the Actinide Series: Meitnerium belongs to the actinide series, a group of elements located in the bottom row of the periodic table.

8. Superheavy Element: Meitnerium is classified as a superheavy element, as it is located beyond the transuranium elements and has an atomic number greater than that of uranium (atomic number 92).

9. Contributions to Nuclear Physics: While Meitnerium itself doesn't have practical applications, the research into its properties and behavior contributes to our understanding of nuclear physics and the behavior of heavy nuclei.
